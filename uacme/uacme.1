.SH "DESCRIPTION"


\fIuacme\fR is a client for the ACMEv2 protocol described in RFC8555, written in plain C with minimal dependencies (libcurl and one of GnuTLS, OpenSSL or mbedTLS)\&. The ACMEv2 protocol allows a Certificate Authority (https://letsencrypt\&.org is a popular one) and an applicant to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance\&. The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation\&. For more information see https://tools\&.ietf\&.org/html/rfc8555

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fI\-a, \-\-acme\-url\fR \fIURL\fR
ACMEv2 server directory object \fIURL\fR\&. If not specified \fIuacme\fR uses one of the following:

.RS

.TP
\fIhttps://acme\-v02\&.api\&.letsencrypt\&.org/directory\fR
production URL

.TP
\fIhttps://acme\-staging\-v02\&.api\&.letsencrypt\&.org/directory\fR

.RE
.IP

.TP
\fI\-b, \-\-bits\fR \fIBITS\fR
key bit length (default 2048 for RSA, 256 for EC)\&. Only applies to newly generated keys\&. RSA key length must be a multiple of 8 between 2048 and 8192\&. EC key length must be either 256 (\fINID_X9_62_prime256v1\fR curve) or 384 (\fINID_secp384r1\fR curve)\&.

.TP
\fI\-c, \-\-confdir\fR \fICONFDIR\fR
Use configuration directory \fICONFDIR\fR (default \fI/etc/ssl/uacme\fR)\&. The structure is as follows (multiple \fIIDENTIFIERs\fR allowed)

.RS

.TP
\fICONFDIR/private/key\&.pem\fR
ACME account private key

.TP
\fICONFDIR/private/IDENTIFIER/key\&.pem\fR
certificate key for \fIIDENTIFIER\fR 

.TP
\fICONFDIR/IDENTIFIER/cert\&.pem\fR
certificate for \fIIDENTIFIER\fR 

.RE
.IP

.TP
\fI\-d, \-\-days\fR \fIDAYS\fR
Do not reissue certificates that are still valid for longer than \fIDAYS\fR (default 30)\&. See also \fI\-o, \-\-no\-ocsp\fR\&.

.TP
\fI\-e, \-\-eab\fR \fIKEYID:KEY\fR
Specify RFC8555 External Account Binding credentials according to https://tools\&.ietf\&.org/html/rfc8555#section\-7\&.3\&.4, in order to associate a new ACME account with an existing account in a non\-ACME system such as a CA customer database\&. \fIKEYID\fR must be an ASCII string\&. \fIKEY\fR must be base64url\-encoded\&.

.TP
\fI\-f, \-\-force\fR
Force certificate reissuance regardless of expiration date\&.

.TP
\fI\-h, \-\-hook\fR \fIPROGRAM\fR
Challenge hook program\&. If not specified \fIuacme\fR interacts with the user for every ACME challenge, printing information about the challenge type, token and authorization on stderr\&. If specified \fIuacme\fR executes \fIPROGRAM\fR (a binary, a shell script or any file that can be executed by the operating system) for every challenge with the following 5 string arguments:

.RS

.TP
\fIMETHOD\fR
one of \fIbegin\fR, \fIdone\fR or \fIfailed\fR\&.

.RS

.TP
\fIbegin\fR
is called at the beginning of the challenge\&. \fIPROGRAM\fR must return 0 to accept it\&. Any other return code declines the challenge\&. Neither \fIdone\fR nor \fIfailed\fR method calls are made for declined challenges\&.

.TP
\fIdone\fR
is called upon successful completion of an accepted challenge\&.

.TP
\fIfailed\fR
is called upon failure of an accepted challenge\&.

.RE
.IP

.TP
\fIIDENT\fR
The identifier the challenge refers to

.TP
\fITOKEN\fR
The challenge token

.TP
\fIAUTH\fR
The key authorization (for \fIdns\-01\fR and \fItls\-alpn\-01\fR already converted to the base64url\-encoded SHA256 digest format)

.RE
.IP

.TP
\fI\-l, \-\-alternate\fR \fIN\fR | \fIFP\fR
According to https://tools\&.ietf\&.org/html/rfc8555#section\-7\&.4\&.2 the server MAY provide one or more additional certificate download URLs, each pointing to alternative certificate chains starting with the same end\-entity certificate\&. This option allows selecting one such chain in one of two ways\&. A positive integer \fIN\fR makes \fIuacme\fR select the Nth alternative chain in the order presented by the server\&. A colon (\fI:\fR) separated list of two or more 2\-digit hexadecimal numbers \fIFP\fR makes \fIuacme\fR select the first alternative chain containing a certificate whose SHA256 fingerprint begins with \fIFP\fR\&. In both cases \fIuacme\fR falls back to the main certificate URL if it cannot match an alternative chain or the download thereof fails\&.

.TP
\fI\-m, \-\-must\-staple\fR
Request certificates with the RFC7633 Certificate Status Request TLS Feature Extension, informally also known as "OCSP Must\-Staple"\&. This option is ignored when using an externally supplied Certificate Signing Request file (see USAGE below)\&.

.TP
\fI\-n, \-\-never\-create\fR
By default \fIuacme\fR creates directories/keys if they do not exist\&. When this option is specified \fIuacme\fR never does so and instead exits with an error if anything required is missing\&.

.TP
\fI\-o, \-\-no\-ocsp\fR
When this flag is \fInot\fR specified and the certificate has an Authority Information Access extension with an OCSP server location according to https://tools\&.ietf\&.org/html/rfc5280#section\-4\&.2\&.2\&.1  \fIuacme\fR makes an OCSP request to the server; if the certificate is reported as revoked \fIuacme\fR forces reissuance regardless of the expiration date\&. See also \fI\-d, \-\-days\fR\&.

.TP
\fI\-s, \-\-staging\fR
Use Let&#8217;s Encrypt staging URL for testing\&. This only works if \fI\-a, \-\-acme\-url\fR is \fINOT\fR specified\&.

.TP
\fI\-t, \-\-type\fR=\fIRSA\fR | \fIEC\fR
Key type, either RSA or EC\&. Only applies to newly generated keys\&. The bit length can be specified with \fI\-b, \-\-bits\fR\&.

.TP
\fI\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
By default \fIuacme\fR only produces output upon errors or when user interaction is required\&. When this option is specified \fIuacme\fR prints information about what is going on on stderr\&. This option can be specified more than once to increase verbosity\&.

.TP
\fI\-V, \-\-version\fR
Print program version on stderr and exit\&.

.TP
\fI\-y, \-\-yes\fR
Autoaccept ACME server terms (if any) upon new account creation\&.

.TP
\fI\-?, \-\-help\fR
Print a brief usage text on stderr and exit\&.

.SH "USAGE"

.TP
\fIuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR ...] \fInew\fR [\fIEMAIL\fR]
Create a new ACME account with optional \fIEMAIL\fR contact\&. If the account private key does not exist at \fICONFDIR/private/key\&.pem\fR a new key is generated unless \fI\-n, \-\-never\-create\fR is specified\&. A valid account must be created \fIbefore\fR any other operation can succeed (with the exception of certificate revocation requests signed by the certificate private key)\&. Any certificate issued by the ACME server is associated with a single account\&. An account can be associated with multiple certificates, subject of course to the rate limits imposed by the ACME server\&.

.TP
\fIuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR ...] \fIupdate\fR [\fIEMAIL\fR]
Update the \fIEMAIL\fR associated with the ACME account corresponding to the account private key\&. If \fIEMAIL\fR is not specified the account contact email is removed\&.

.TP
\fIuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR ...] \fIdeactivate\fR
Deactivate the ACME account corresponding to the account private key\&. \fIWARNING\fR this action is irreversible\&. Users may wish to do this when the account key is compromised or decommissioned\&. A deactivated account can no longer request certificate issuances and revocations or access resources related to the account\&.

.TP
\fIuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR ...] \fInewkey\fR
Change the ACME account private key\&. If the new account private key does not exist at \fICONFDIR/private/newkey\&.pem\fR it is generated unless \fI\-n, \-\-never\-create\fR is specified\&. The new key is then submitted to the server and if the operation succeeds the old key is hardlinked to \fICONFDIR/private/key\-TIMESTAMP\&.pem\fR before renaming \fICONFDIR/private/newkey\&.pem\fR to \fICONFDIR/private/key\&.pem\fR\&.

.TP
\fIuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR ...] \fIissue\fR \fIIDENTIFIER\fR [\fIALTNAME\fR ...]
Issue a certificate for \fIIDENTIFIER\fR with zero or more \fIALTNAMEs\fR\&. If a certificate is already available at \fICONFDIR/IDENTIFIER/cert\&.pem\fR for the specified \fIIDENTIFIER\fR and \fIALTNAMEs\fR and is still valid for longer than \fIDAYS\fR no action is taken unless \fI\-f, \-\-force\fR is specified or \fI\-o, \-\-no\-ocsp\fR is \fInot\fR specified and the certificate is reported as revoked by the OCSP server\&. The new certificate is saved to \fICONFDIR/IDENTIFIER/cert\&.pem\fR\&. If the certificate file already exists it is hardlinked to \fICONFDIR/IDENTIFIER/cert\-TIMESTAMP\&.pem\fR before overwriting\&. The private key for the certificate is loaded from \fICONFDIR/private/IDENTIFIER/key\&.pem\fR\&. If no such file exists, a new key is generated unless \fI\-n, \-\-never\-create\fR is specified\&. Wildcard \fIIDENTIFIERs\fR or \fIALTNAMEs\fR are dealt with correctly, as long as the ACME server supports them; note that any such wildcards are automatically removed from the configuration subdirectory name: for example a certificate for \fI*\&.test\&.com\fR is saved to \fICONFDIR/test\&.com/cert\&.pem\fR\&. IP address \fIIDENTIFIERs\fR and \fIALTNAMEs\fR are also supported according to https://tools\&.ietf\&.org/html/rfc8738#section\-3 

.TP
\fIuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR ...] \fIissue\fR \fICSRFILE\fR
Issue a certificate based on a RFC2986 Certificate Signing Request contained in \fICSRFILE\fR, which must be in PEM format\&. In this mode of issuance \fIuacme\fR neither needs nor generates the certificate private key, but it is of course the responsibility of the user to ensure that the CSR is constructed and signed appropriately\&. If a certificate file \fICSRBASE\-cert\&.pem\fR (where \fICSRBASE\fR is obtained by stripping the extension, if any, from \fICSRFILE\fR) is already available in the same directory containing \fICSRFILE\fR, and is still valid for longer than \fIDAYS\fR no action is taken unless \fI\-f, \-\-force\fR is specified or \fI\-o, \-\-no\-ocsp\fR is \fInot\fR specified and the certificate is reported as revoked by the OCSP server\&. If the certificate file already exists it is hardlinked to \fIBASENAME\-cert\-TIMESTAMP\&.pem\fR before overwriting\&. Wildcard identifiers in the CSR are dealt with correctly, as long as the ACME server supports them\&. IP addresses are also supported according to https://tools\&.ietf\&.org/html/rfc8738#section\-3 

.TP
\fIuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR ...] \fIrevoke\fR \fICERTFILE\fR [\fICERTKEYFILE\fR]
Revoke the certificate stored in \fICERTFILE\fR\&. The revocation request is signed with the private key of either the certificate, when \fICERTKEYFILE\fR is specified; or the ACME account associated with the certificate, when only \fICERTFILE\fR is specified\&. In the first instance the account key and the configuration directory are not required\&. If successful \fICERTFILE\fR is renamed to \fIrevoked\-TIMESTAMP\&.pem\fR\&.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"

.TP
\fI0\fR
Success

.TP
\fI1\fR
Certificate not reissued because it is still current

.TP
\fI2\fR
Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; processing failure; unexpected error)\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE HOOK SCRIPT"
